/**
 * Port roles: which of a controller's MIDI ports can carry what is played.
 *
 * A controller rarely exposes one input. The MiniLab 3 exposes four on Windows
 * and only two of them ever carry a played note; the other two are a DAW
 * control surface and a 5-pin pass-through. Ranking them alike armed whichever
 * one the operating system enumerated first, and every key press was then
 * discarded as coming from an unselected input.
 *
 * That ranking used to be a regular expression over the word "minilab". It is
 * now `device.ports[]` in the profile -- specification section 4.2 -- and this
 * file is what reads it. Nothing here knows a device: the profile arrives as an
 * argument and is never imported, which is the entire difference between "works
 * with the MiniLab" and "works with the controller that is loaded".
 *
 * MATCHING, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY REFUSES TO DO
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * A declared port matches a physical one when the physical name CONTAINS the
 * declared name, both lower-cased with their whitespace removed.
 *
 * Containment rather than equality, because the operating system decorates: the
 * port one machine calls "Minilab3 MIDI" is handed back as "MIDIIN2 (Minilab3
 * MIDI)" on another. Whitespace removed, because the same device is spelled
 * "Minilab3" by its driver and "MiniLab 3" by its manual, and a profile author
 * copies whichever one he is looking at.
 *
 * What it refuses is to guess. A port the profile does not declare belongs to no
 * profile: there is no fallback onto a resemblance to the vendor or the model
 * string. That is the point rather than a limitation -- a controller whose ports
 * are named otherwise is a profile to fix, as data, which is exactly what
 * DECISIONS.md D-020 bought. A heuristic fallback would put the old regular
 * expression back, one device at a time.
 *
 * TWO DECLARATIONS MATCHING ONE PORT
 * ----------------------------------
 * Legitimate: a profile may declare "Minilab3" alongside "Minilab3 MIDI". The
 * longer declaration wins, because it is the more specific identification, and
 * ties fall back to declaration order. Resolving it by array position alone
 * would decide by accident, which is what the validator already refuses for two
 * bindings answering one message.

 *
 * Ties keep enumeration order: a profile that ranks two ports equally has said
 * it does not care, and inventing a preference here would be deciding by
 * accident on its behalf.
